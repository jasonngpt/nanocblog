I just got a [Jolla](www.jolla.com) Sailfish phone through a friend. First impressions of it seem pretty impressive and positive.

Jolla Sailfish runs Sailfish OS, which is supposedly the successor of Maemo from Nokia. The Jolla phone is from a group of ex-Nokia employees who were working on Maemo previously. The OS is based largely on gestures and the Jolla phone embodies the concept perfectly with only the power button and the volume buttons. 

One big advantage the Sailfish OS has is that it is able to install Android apps, co-existing with the native apps. But the phone itself seems to be rather pricey, at EUR399.

This new OS addition to the mobile wars might prove to be interesting. Hopefully Jolla brings with it the reputation Nokia used to have with their high quality devices.

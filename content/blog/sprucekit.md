Update on the PocketSpruce project I am on. I submitted a request to list this application into the Pocket list of applications, and was informed that I needed a new name as the name "PocketSpruce" contains Pocket. 

<!-- more -->

I settled on [SpruceKit](http://www.sprucekit.com) as the new name. Porting of PocketSpruce to SpruceKit is done already. Do check it out.

Update on the PocketSpruce project I am on. I submitted a request to list this application into the Pocket list of applications, and was informed that I needed a new name as PocketSpruce contains Pocket. 

<!-- more -->

So far I think I settled on SpruceKit as the new name of the application. Will be porting PocketSpruce to SpruceKit in the meantime. 

Do drop me a note for suggestions of a better name.
